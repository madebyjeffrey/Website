<h1>SOCR Password Policy</h1>

<p>The following password policy is approved by the Chief Technical Officer, July 26, 2013.

<p>In accordance with the <a href="https://ldap.uwindsor.ca/cgi-bin/userid/change_passwd/chgpasswd">ITS Password Standards</a>, SOCR's passwords require the use of three character classes for passwords of eight characters. This means a password can contain a capital letter, a number, and regular letters and be eight characters long. 

<p>No dictionary words, or variations on a username are permitted - forward or reverse. It is not recommended to use the same password as you use on any other system.

<p>We use these standards to be as secure as ITS.
