            Motion 201208-01: Removal of Typographical Errors in Constitution
            Brought by: Jeffrey Drake, RTO

            Purpose: Three typographical errors have been found when converting 
            the constitution to a Markdown document. This bill is to amend the
            Constitution to fix these errors.

            Modification: In S4.1.2, the words "shall be also be known" are to 
            be replaced with "shall also be known". In S4.2.6 in section 
            "Public Documentation", the words "The Chief Records shall make" 
            shall be replaced with "The Chief of Records shall make"

            Furthermore, In the same article, in section "Public Documentation",
            the words "documentation update to date with regards to Board
            decisions" shall be replaced with "documentation up to date with
            regards to Board decisions."

            Motion 201208-02: Creation of Additional Volunteer Administrators
            Brought by: Jeffrey Drake, RTO

            Purpose: In administrating the server, the technical staff have found it 
            necessary to expand administrators to include additional skill sets. To
            that end, we propose a technical committee be created to provide for an 
            official body of technical talent. The members of the committee shall 
            exclusively be the CTO, RTO, and President (S6.5) and those assigned by 
            mutual consent of the CTO and RTO.

            Modification: Inserting before S6.4 Other Committees but after S6.3. 
            Auditing Committee, with all sections including S6.4 and after be 
            incremented appropriately. The new section shall be entitled S6.4 
            Technical Administration Committee and shall be worded: "The Technical 
            Administration Committee shall consist of the Chief Technical Officer and 
            the Reserve Technical Officer and any individual so appointed by 
            unanimous agreement of the two aforementioned officers. Meetings of the 
            committee shall be held on an as needed basis as determined by either of 
            the aforementioned two officers. The officer who called the meeting shall 
            set the meeting date and time. An official call of meeting shall be 
            communicated via email or additional modes of communications as deemed 
            necessary no less than one week in advance of the meeting. The members of 
            the committee shall be authorized on an as needed basis or ongoing basis, 
            as determined by at least one of the aforementioned two officers to 
            participate in administrative roles."

            Motion 201208-03: Expansion of the Chief of Internal Affairs
            Brought by: Jeffrey Drake RTO, and Matthew Renaud CIA.

            Purpose: The Chief of Internal Affairs is lacking in real responsibility, 
            and would like the task to be expanded to include mediation of disputes 
            and be kept up to date with all decisions made by members with 
            responsibility to maintain accountability.

            Modification: Change S4.2.8 to say, "The Chief of Internal Affairs shall 
            be responsible for the collection of key decisions made, arbitrating 
            disputes, maintaining documentation, and assuming the role of the Chief 
            of Records in its vacancy. 

            Key Decisions: The Chief of Internal Affairs shall be made aware of all 
            key decisions made by persons responsible and as determined by same. 

            Disputes: The Chief of Internal Affairs shall be responsible for 
            mediating disputes between Board Members and/or members 
            when the dispute cannot be worked out between themselves. 

            Dispute Procedure: A procedure for working out disputes shall be 
            documented by the Chief of Internal Affairs, approved by the board, and 
            published on the primary website.
